## Quick Notes

The radioactive wasteland's only sign of natural life are a few trees and many hostile mobs. Due to it's radioactive nature, a full space suit or a power helment equiped with the environmental module will allow you to surivive both indoors and outdoors; do note that the space suit looses durability over time so do be careful. Massive tunnels stretch beneath the mountainous terrain from past players mining the world for its riches, ores can still be found in the floor, walls, and ceiling of these mining tunnels making mining for ill-prepared players easier. Titus is one of the two smallest worlds, giving it a low gravitational pull allowing a player to jump massive distances.
